        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                3 medium-sized potatoes (approx. 370g in total, unpeeled, left
                whole – Maris Pipers, King Edward and Desirée are all good
                choices)
            </li>
            <li>50g butter, melted</li>
            <li>4 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>
            Cook the potatoes in a saucepan of boiling water for 10 mins then
            drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
            Coarsely grate the potatoes into a bowl discarding any skin that
            comes off in your hand as you grate. Season well with salt and
            pepper and pour over half the butter. Mix well then divide the mix
            into 8 and shape into patties or squares. The hash browns can be
            prepared a day ahead and chilled until ready to cook or frozen for
            up to a month.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
            To cook, heat the oil and the remaining butter in a frying pan until
            sizzling and gently fry the hash browns, in batches if needed, for
            4-5 mins on each side until crisp and golden. Serve straight away or
            leave in a low oven to keep warm.
