        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            While the natural sugars in the bananas add sweetness to the
            previous recipe, pancake lovers who prefer savory to sweet can go
            with this sugar-free, two ingredient pancake recipe from Run Eat
            Repeat, which uses only oats and eggs. For extra flavor, protein and
            healthy fats, you can also use your favorite nut butter as a
            topping!
